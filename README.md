# IMPORTANT NOTICE:

Hello. This `TechStudent10`'s alt. I used this account to switch the usernames around (to avoid confusion with other social media). Please go to [@TechStudent10](https://github.com/TechStudent10) to find my main account. Below is the old README.

## So, you've found my alt...
My main account is [@TechStudent10](https://github.com/TechStudent10) and this is my alt account. You probably got here because of the following reasons:

- It was featured in a video
- You accidentally pinged the wrong account
- You typed TechStudent10 instead of TechStudent11 in the URL (most probable)
